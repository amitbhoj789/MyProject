        <p class="text-blue">Before the advent of the internet, the process of job hunting was fundamentally
            different. The classified sections of local and national newspapers were the primary sources of job listings.
            People would buy a newspaper and carefully comb through the job postings to find suitable positions. This
            conventional method of job hunting underwent a dramatic transformation with the rise of the internet in the
            mid-to-late 90s, and online job searching became the new standard.</p>
        <h5 class="mt-30 mb-5">Job Searching - The Traditional Approach</h5>
        <p>Traditionally, job searching meant actively looking for job vacancies across different channels such as job
            boards and company websites. Job seekers would create and tailor their resume and cover letter for each specific
            job opening they were interested in. This approach could be time-consuming and sometimes overwhelming, as it
            required reading and evaluating numerous job descriptions. Determining a good fit based purely on the
            information in a job advert was often challenging, making the process stressful and inefficient.</p>
        <h5 class="mt-30 mb-5">Job Matching - The Modern Approach</h5>
        <p class="modern-approach"><img src="{{config.assetsImages+'plus.png'}}"> Contrastingly, the modern approach, job
            matching, leverages technology to pair job seekers with relevant
            opportunities based on their skills, experience, and other attributes. Platforms dedicated to job matching such
            as BothMatch.com utilize advanced algorithms to pinpoint the most suitable matches between jobseekers and
            employers.</p>
        <p class="mt-20 mb-20 modern-approach"><img src="{{config.assetsImages+'plus.png'}}"> Job matching can be likened to
            having a personal assistant who intimately understands your skills,
            interests, and career aspirations, and then links you to the job opportunities that best align with these. This
            method substantially reduces the time and effort traditionally spent on job hunting, as it efficiently filters
            through innumerable job posts to identify those most applicable to you.</p>
        <p class="mb-20 modern-approach"><img src="{{config.assetsImages+'plus.png'}}"> In essence, job matching provides a
            more streamlined and personalized approach compared to
            traditional job searching. It removes much of the hassle associated with job hunting, making the path to finding
            your ideal role a lot smoother and more efficient. </p>
